    picture: "/image/statue.avif",
    text: `The Statue of Liberty is an internationally recognized piece of architecture.
         With its turquoise hue, she looks over the ocean and her city, 
         standing proudly and quintessentially American (aptly, for a movie about an American landmark, 
        every single addition on this list comes from the USA).
        Too often forgotten, however, is that the statue's origins hail originally from France, 
        creating an oxymoron of patriotism for the country and an appropriate metaphor for any travelers approaching New York City's shoreline.
         In the world of film, a towering figure so distinctly human as the Statue of Liberty has naturally been utilized, ripely mocked,
          and repeatedly destroyed on more than one occasion. 
          Below, our list charts some of the best.With the whole of New York City having witnessed a genuine spaceship leave Earth in Men in Black 2,
           (not to mention the millions of people who saw an alien blow up above their heads),
            a giant cover up operation will need to be planned and executed.
             Fortunately for the titular men in black, the Statue of Liberty holds in it a huge Neuralyzer capable of wiping all of NYC's residents' collective memories.
              Pretty handy for a crack team that definitely don't exist.We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200 tonnes.
               As the Be Sharps go on tour in the first episode of The Simpsons' fifth season, they are brought to New York.
                In appreciation of the statue, Homer can't help but give her a shout-out.
                 A patron takes Homer literally though and jumps into the harbor, believing that this enormous woman will devour us all.
       Maybe she still will… Only time will tell.The Simpsons has actually featured the Statue of Liberty in 11 episodes (including a late season delight,
       The Fool Monty) and two special shorts.Most famous now for its vague but inviting marketing in the build-up to release, the trailer for Cloverfield showed a handheld camera documenting some kind of attack in New York City.
         Cloverfield's really not a very good movie, but the blasé attitude from the monster to destroy such an iconic character like the Statue of Liberty is a neat moment in this movie that taps into America's post-9/11 fears.While no,
    this technically isn't the Statue of Liberty (as we're in the very fictional town of Gotham City), Joel Schumacher's comic book landscape has its own Libertas in this fun-as-Hell cold open.`,

    title: "What Makes Chainsaw Man Stand Out Against Other Shonen Anime?",
    subject: "featurs",
    id: "Chainsaw",
    picture:"/image/chainsaw.avif",
    text: `Chainsaw Man, the breakout ultraviolent shonen series, has recently wrapped up the first season of its anime adaptation, bringing the dark humor and tragic themes of its source material to the small screen.
     While some may have critiqued the show's animation quality and pacing, most would agree that it did a fantastic job of introducing Chainsaw Man's world to a wider audience as the accompanying manga series enters its second major arc.
      Those who are holding out from viewing the series, however, may need a little more convincing before they give the anime a shot.

Anime is synonymous with a lot of things: action, drama, romance, and while Chainsaw Man largely falls into the first category, there's already a plethora of material for anime fans to watch through.
 Isn't Chainsaw Man just another seasonal action show? Or is it something a little more profound? It's not as clear-cut as you may think. What exactly makes Chainsaw Man stand out compared to other shonen anime?`,

    picture: "/image/gladdiator.avif",
    text: `Following recent rumors that production on the long-gestating Gladiator sequel is finally underway,
     we now have our first major casting announcement as Normal People and Aftersun star Paul Mescal has been tapped to play the lead role. According to Deadline, 
    sources close to production have revealed that Mescal is now in talks to join Gladiator 2, with director Ridley Scott set to return to helm the project.

    Ever since talk turned to a Gladiator follow-up, audiences have wondered how exactly this would be achieved considering that Russell Crowe’s main character Maximus Decimus Meridius dies at the end of the first movie.
     Well, the report goes on to confirm prior rumors, revealing that Mescal will take the lead in the story as Lucius Verus, the son of Lucilla, who was played in the Oscar-winning first outing by Connie Nielsen. Now a grown man,
      Gladiator 2 will take place decades after the first movie and is likely to follow Lucius as he searches for the truth about his biological father, discovering that he is in fact the secret son of Maximus.
    
    Though very early in his career, Paul Mescal has already proven himself to be of monumental talent thanks to roles in the likes of The Lost Daughter and the romantic drama series Normal People.
     The young actor is currently receiving all manner of praise and award nominations for his role in the drama Aftersun, in which he plays the loving, idealistic father of 11-year-old Sophie,
      who years later begins to reminisce about their last holiday at a fading vacation resort.`,
